# Migrating from code_text_field to 0.1

This code editor was forked from [code_text_field](https://pub.dev/packages/code_text_field)
by BertrandBev, and then many features were added to it.

The first versions preserve much of compatibility for your convenience.

1. Replace `code_text_field` package with this one.
2. Do not use `CodeField.expands` because otherwise the code scrolls but line numbers freeze.
   Instead put the entire widget to `Expnaded`.
3. Use `CodeTheme` widget instead of passing a theme to `CodeController`.
